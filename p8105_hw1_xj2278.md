## Problem 1

Creating a data frame that has 10 subjects randomly sampled from a
standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether these
values are greater than 0, a corresponding character vector, and a
factor vector with 3 different levels.

``` r
P1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0, 
  chr_vec = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
  fct_vec = factor(c("red", "blue", "yellow", "blue", "red", "red", "yellow", "blue", "red", "yellow"))
)
```

Taking the mean of each variable:

``` r
num = pull(P1_df, norm_samp)
logi = pull(P1_df, norm_samp_pos)
chr = pull(P1_df, chr_vec)
fct = pull(P1_df, fct_vec)

mean(num)
```

    ## [1] 0.1322028

``` r
mean(logi)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(chr)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(chr): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(fct)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(fct): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

mean() works for the numeric and logical vectors, while it does not work
for character and factor vectors. Taking averages for numbers and
logical vector (TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0) is doable, while it is not
reasonable to get means of characters and factors.

``` r
num_logi = as.numeric(logi)
num_chr = as.numeric(chr)
num_fct = as.numeric(fct)
```

The logical and factor vectors are successfully transformed into numeric
vectors, while the character vector fails to do so. For the logical
vector, TRUE and FALSE are assigned values 1 and 0; for the factor
vectors, the three factor levels are assigned 1, 2, and 3 as values.
However, the ten characters are distinct and cannot be assigned numeric
values. Thus, we cannot take average of character vector since it cannot
be representated by numeric values.
